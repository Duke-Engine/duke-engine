/**
 * The ground and the rocks, and the ability to throw them away and lay down a
 * different world.
 *
 * <p>Split out from the client for one reason: it owns a rule that is easy to
 * break and was broken. Terrain used to be attached straight to the scene root
 * when the window opened, which quietly assumed a world is built once and lasts
 * forever. A game that lays out a new world — a roguelike beginning a new run —
 * broke that assumption, and the client went on drawing walls that no longer
 * existed while the units moved around a map the player could not see.
 *
 * <p>The rule is that rebuilding <b>replaces</b>. Everything goes into a node this
 * class owns, and every rebuild empties it first, so the scene holds one world's
 * worth of geometry no matter how many runs the player dies through. Keeping that
 * in a small class with a node and a grid — and no application, window or GPU —
 * is what lets a test hold it still.
 *
 * <p>Materials arrive through a factory rather than an {@code AssetManager} so the
 * shape of the scene can be checked without one.
 *
 * <p>A game may ask for <b>discovery</b>, in which case the scene can be told,
 * each frame, what to leave out of the picture — see {@link #applyDiscovery}.
 * What it does <em>not</em> do is decide how bright anything is drawn: the fog is
 * a picture of the map ({@link FogMap}) that the terrain's own material samples by
 * world position, so a brightness decided here — per cell, per piece, per anything
 * but per fragment — would be a floor of squares whatever it was computed from.
 * Games that do not ask for discovery pay nothing: no handles are kept and the
 * loop never runs, which matters because an RTS map is many times larger than a
 * dungeon floor.
