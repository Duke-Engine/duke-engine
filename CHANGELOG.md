# Changelog

Versions are `major.minor.patch`. While the major is 0, a minor may break what came before — and
when it does, this page says exactly what to change and how.

## 0.3.0

**Two breaking changes to the `.duke` syntax, both the same correction.** The rule the format is
built on is that a block *is* its record and every line in it names one of that record's components.
Two things stood outside that rule, and now neither does.

### A map is a list of its entries, not a block of them

A map used to be written as a block named after its component, each line an entry:

```
ActiveBody
  MaxHealth = 480
  Armor                 ; before
    FLAME = 0.5
    SNIPER = 2.0
  End
End
```

`FLAME` is not a component of anything, so that block broke the rule. A map is a field now, written
the way every other list is:

```
ActiveBody
  MaxHealth = 480
  Armor = [FLAME = 0.5, SNIPER = 2.0]     ; after
End
```

Where an entry's value holds more than a line does, it is a block opened by the key it belongs to —
which is how a `Map<String, Piece>` became writable at all:

```
Pieces = [
  Minimap = Piece
    Texture = ui/panel/minimap.png
    Inset = 16
  End,
  Portrait = Piece
    Texture = ui/panel/portrait.png
  End
]
```

The reader tells the two apart by shape alone: a bare word with a body under it is no list of
values, because that one carries the comma that holds its entries apart.

**To migrate:** a map block becomes one line. The old form is now an error that names the component
and prints the line to write in its place, so `./gradlew build` finds every one of them for you.
`Binder.map(Block, Type)` is gone from the API.

### A list of blocks separates its entries with a comma

A list of values was written `[a, b]` and a list of blocks was written with nothing between them, so
one `[ … ]` had two rules. `End` followed by a word was two entries and `End` followed by `]` was
one, and nothing on the page said which — the reader had to count.

```
Modules = [
  ActiveBody
    MaxHealth = 480
  End,                  ; new: required between entries
  MoveUpdate
    Speed = 10
  End                   ; optional after the last, as in [a, b,]
]
```

**To migrate:** run [docs/plan/2026-09-22-commas.js](docs/plan/2026-09-22-commas.js) over your data
files. It is textual on purpose — the new parser rejects the old form, so it cannot be used to read
what is being migrated — and it needs only the indentation these files already keep:

```
node docs/plan/2026-09-22-commas.js $(find src/main/resources -name '*.duke')
```

It prints what it changed and touches nothing it did not have to. A missing comma is an error that
names the block it belongs before, so the build finds whatever the script missed.

## 0.2.0

The first published release: `core`, `rts`, `game`, `client3d`, `kit` and the `bom`, on Maven
Central under `uz.duke-engine`.
